# MC-Final-Project
Smart-Efficient Garbage Collection System Using QR Code Technology

Our project aims to use technology to make garbage collection more efficient 
and address the issues faced by users and garbage collectors in most societies. 
By placing QR code-enabled bins in front of each house, citizens can scan the 
code when they throw garbage, changing the bin's colour from green to red. 
This enables the garbage collector to see all the red-marked bins on a map and 
plan their route accordingly. When the collector empties a bin, they scan the 
QR code again, changing the bin colour back to green. In addition, citizens 
can track the live location of the garbage collector and plan when to dispose 
of their garbage. This project can reduce pollution and health hazards caused 
by garbage and help the municipal body track which bins are cleaned regularly and which are not.
